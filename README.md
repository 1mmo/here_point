# Description üìù
The idea of the project is to create a website for travelers.
Anyone who has ever used default sites with city sights knows that this is a trap and it is often boring there. The authors of such sites may have never been to this city, but at the same time they advise you to visit some museum or monument. All because these are standard entertainments in absolutely any city.

Those who travel often understand how nice it is to find places that are not accessible to tourists. Such places are known to the inhabitants of this city, while tourists have to look for them at random. . We need to give everyone the opportunity to talk about their favorite place. Let him take photos, write how to get to this place and put a mark on the map

### Main page
The site has a main page that shows random places around the world, each place has an author, rating, photos, description and coordinates.
